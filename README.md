As a programmer, I remain a dreamer and idealistic visionary, and though this is now tempered with pragmatism about what can realistically be achieved in a given timescale, I still believe we should strive to make our ideals a reality.  I have always had a vibrant and colourful inner world, to conquer and thought experiment in, reflected in the software I produce.  I've learned a great deal in the last three years about competent programming, Agile practices, problem solving, good teamwork and pairing.  I can leave the world a better place than I found it.  I would love to contribute this potential to the space industry, such as ESA's EXOMars Rover or the Sentinel Satellite programme, where I can take part in our expansion outward into the cosmos.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

A well practiced and capable problem solver, I enjoy the process of finding solutions to all varieties of obstacles.

* Provided solutions and helped resolve a broad variety of programmatic and product issues with my team at **Compare The Market** (CTM): provided the solution to a redirect issue in our AMP pages, wrote the refactor to our SEO Tooling and helped navigate through to solutions for image compression in our CMS and asset storage in AWS.

* Regularly solved problems of information provision and dissemination among colleagues and service users in previous roles: created crib sheets and instructional documents to summarise key information, improving workflow efficiency.

* Practised solving myriad software development problems at Makers Academy.  Worked with pair partners to refactor and pass failing tests, configure test and development environments, and develop project ideas, creating a broad variety of github repos.

* Engage in board games, computer games and pen-and-paper rpgs, promoting strategic thinking, conflict resolution and teamwork.  Includes a weekly Pathfinder gaming group, and the Magic: the Gathering group at Makers Academy.

#### Designing: Analysis, Planning & Research

Adept with managing the design process: breaking down processess and systems into components, to better understand how the whole fits together; building out step-by-step to achieve a goal, in a way others may easily follow; and gathering the relevant information to inform these two elements effectively.

* At CTM, I designed and implemented a full refactor of our in-house SEO Tooling.  I also helped restructure the inheritance architecture of our CMS page types to better implement AMP pages in our solution.

* At **King's College Hospital** (KCH), automated an inbox filing system to manage a high volume of emails, reducing time spent on this task significantly and allowing productivity improvements for other tasks.

* Also at KCH, built a SQL script to work around an occasional bug in the user-management system, which meant new users were not always imported into the user database properly.

* Helped design and build several projects at Makers Academy using Ruby and Javascript, including Alibot and Markpad.

#### Support

Throughout my career, I have supported people and projects, listening and rapidly responding to needs and requirements and endeavouring to anticipate how they may change as time progresses.

* CTM has given me extensive experience of Agile methodologies and practices which have complemented my support skills developed in previous roles.  I helped the Team switch from using React to using AMP in our site tech stack redesign project and have taken on board various requirement changes for our SEO Tooling.

* In a role assigned from **Prospect Us**, I provided research project support across three departments.  My support allowed the research staff to gather, interpret and present their data within the projected timeline for the project.

* Provision of information and instruction to end users formed one of the core functions of my role at **King's College Hospital**, enabling colleagues on my team to improve productivity in other areas of their work.

* Pairing with fellow cohort members during the boot camp allowed me to exercise these skills across many coding exercises, helping each other in turn to gain insights and experience into the design and construction process of software.

## Familiar Tech
* Cloud Computing: AWS, Consul, Terraform
* System Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk, Eggplant Site Monitoring Services
* Frameworks: Node, Moustache, Angular
* Programming _et. al._ Languages: C Sharp, Java, Javascript, Ruby, Python, Sass
