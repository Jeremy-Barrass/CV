# Jeremy Barrass

A dreamer and impractical visionary who wants to go ahead and make it real anyway, to prove all the naysayers wrong.  I've recently learned a lot about how to interact with a medium where the potential to build the fruits of creativity seem endless and there's the real possiblity that I can leave the world a better place than I found it.  I would love to contribute this potential to the space industry, where I can take part in our expansion outward into the cosmos.
