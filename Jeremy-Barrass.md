# Jeremy Barrass

A dreamer and impractical visionary who wants to go ahead and make it real anyway, to prove all the naysayers wrong.  I've recently learned a lot about how to interact with a medium where the potential to build the fruits of creativity seem endless and there's the real possiblity that I can leave the world a better place than I found it.  I would love to contribute this potential to the space industry, where I can take part in our expansion outward into the cosmos.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

I have always enjoyed solving puzzles and problems and have become very adroit at doing so, particularly during my time	at Makers Academy.

* Regularly solved problems of information provision and dissemination amoung colleagues and service users in previous roles: created crib sheets and instructional documents to summarise key information, improving workflow efficiency.

* Practised solving myriad software development problems over the duration of the course at Makers Academy.  Worked with fellow cohort members to refactor and pass failing tests, configure test and development environments, and generate and develop project ideas, generating a broad variety of github repos.
