As a programmer, I'm a dreamer and idealistic visionary who wants to go ahead and make it real, to truly test the limits of the possible.  I have always had a vibrant and colourful inner world, to conquer and thought experiment in, reflected in the software I produce.  I've recently learned a lot about how to interact with computers at a level where I can build virtually anything my imagination might conceive.  I now know there's the real possiblity that I can leave the world a better place than I found it.  I would love to contribute this potential to the space industry, such as ESA's EXOMars Rover or the Sentinel Satellite programme, where I can take part in our expansion outward into the cosmos.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

Enjoy solving puzzles and problems and have become very adroit at doing so, particularly during my time	at Makers Academy.

* Regularly solved problems of information provision and dissemination among colleagues and service users in previous roles: created crib sheets and instructional documents to summarise key information, improving workflow efficiency.

* Practised solving myriad software development problems over the duration of the course at Makers Academy.  Worked with pair partners to refactor and pass failing tests, configure test and development environments, and develop project ideas, creating a broad variety of github repos.

* Engage in board games, computer games and pen-and-paper rpgs, promoting strategic thinking, conflict resolution and teamwork.  Includes a weekly Pathfinder gaming group, and the Magic: the Gathering group at Makers Academy.

#### Designing: Analysis, Planning & Research

Adept with managing the design process: breaking down processess and systems into components, to better understand how the whole fits together; building out step-by-step to achieve a goal, in a way others may easily follow; and gathering the relevant information to inform these two elements effectively.

* At **King's College Hospital** (KCH), automated an inbox filing system to manage a high volume of emails, reducing time spent on this task significantly and allowing productivity improvements for other tasks.

* Also at KCH, built a SQL script to work around an occasional bug in the user-management system, which meant new users were not always imported into the user database properly.

* Helped design and build several projects at Makers Academy using Ruby and Javascript, including Alibot and Markpad.

#### Support

Throughout my vocational career and recent coding boot camp, I have supported people and projects, listening and rapidly responding to needs and requirements and endeavouring to anticipate how they may change as time progresses.

* In a role assigned from **Prospect Us**, I provided research project support across three departments.  My support allowed the research staff to gather, interpret and present their data within the projected timeline for the project.

* Pairing with fellow cohort members during the boot camp allowed me to exercise these skills across many coding exercises, helping each other in turn to gain insights and experience into the design and construction process of software.

* Provision of information and instruction to end users formed one of the core functions of my role at **King's College Hospital**, enabling colleagues on my team to improve productivity in other areas of their work.
